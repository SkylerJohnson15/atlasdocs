# 🧠 AtlasDocs — Production-Ready RAG Document Assistant

AtlasDocs is a cloud-deployed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload PDF or text documents and query them using a grounded AI assistant with citations.

Built with Streamlit, OpenAI, and vector search, AtlasDocs demonstrates practical AI engineering patterns including multi-document retrieval, semantic embeddings, mobile UX optimization, and analytics tracking.
